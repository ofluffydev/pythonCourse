"Tutorial hell", also known as "tutorial purgatory," is a common pitfall that many aspiring programmers and self-taught developers face when learning to code. It refers to the situation where you become overly reliant on following coding tutorials, courses, and guided projects without actively applying the concepts you learn to your own projects or problem-solving scenarios.

In tutorial hell, learners often find themselves stuck in a cycle of continuously consuming educational content without making significant progress in their programming skills. They may feel a false sense of accomplishment after completing a tutorial or course, but struggle when faced with real-world coding challenges or when trying to build projects independently.

Characteristics of tutorial hell include:

1. Over-reliance on hand-holding: Learners become dependent on the step-by-step guidance provided in tutorials, making it difficult for them to develop problem-solving skills and think independently.

2. Lack of practical application: Learners may not apply the concepts they learn to their own projects or real-world scenarios, limiting their ability to solidify their understanding and develop practical skills.

3. Passive learning: Simply watching tutorials or following along with code without actively engaging in the learning process can lead to a superficial understanding of the material.

4. Difficulty in recalling concepts: When learners don't practice applying the concepts they learn, they may struggle to recall and use them effectively when needed.

To escape tutorial hell, it's essential for learners to shift their focus from passive consumption of educational content to active practice and application. This can be achieved by:

1. Building projects independently: Apply the concepts learned in tutorials to create your own projects, even if they are simple or small-scale initially.

2. Solving coding challenges: Engage in problem-solving exercises and coding challenges that test your understanding and require you to think critically.

3. Experimenting and debugging: Don't be afraid to experiment with code, make mistakes, and learn from debugging and troubleshooting.

4. Collaborating with others: Work on projects with other learners or contribute to open-source projects to gain practical experience and learn from more experienced developers.

5. Seeking feedback and code reviews: Share your code with others and ask for feedback to identify areas for improvement and learn best practices.

Remember, tutorials and courses are valuable resources for learning programming concepts, but they should be used as a starting point rather than an end goal. The key to becoming a proficient programmer lies in applying what you learn, practicing regularly, and continuously challenging yourself to grow and improve your skills. You will need to be able to write your own programs without watching a step-by-step video on how to make it, as these videos do not exist for every single case.
