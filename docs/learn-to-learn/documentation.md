Many people will find a framework or library and immediately Google search "Tutorial for" rather than reading the actual documentation. You should understand your programming language at a level that all you need is the API reference and docs, with maybe a few small tutorials to begin with. This is a great thing to help you stay out of [[Tutorial Hell]].

It's okay if you don't understand how libraries work yet, we will be revisiting this with greater depth later on.

Learning to read and understand the documentation for libraries and frameworks is a crucial skill that can help you quickly adapt to new tools and avoid relying on step-by-step tutorials. By developing the ability to navigate and comprehend documentation effectively, you can easily gain a deeper understanding of how a library or framework works, making it easier to use them in your projects without the need for extensive hand-holding from 12-hour long videos and overly specific step-by-step instructions.

Remember this doesn't mean you should memorize every single framework's syntax to use it, it is completely normal to revisit the documentation now and then. Doing so also helps you stay up to date if the library gets any newer updates

Benefits of learning to read documentation:

1. Self-sufficiency: When you can effectively read and understand documentation, you become more self-sufficient as a developer. Instead of relying on tutorials for every aspect of a library or framework, you can explore the official documentation to find the information you need, saving time and effort.

2. Comprehensive understanding: Documentation often provides a comprehensive overview of a library or framework's features, including its API, configuration options, and best practices. By reading the documentation thoroughly, you gain a deeper understanding of the tool's capabilities and limitations, allowing you to make informed decisions when using it in your projects.

3. Staying up to date: Libraries and frameworks often evolve over time, with new features, bug fixes, and deprecations. By referring to the official documentation, you can stay informed about the latest changes and ensure that you're using the most current and recommended practices.

4. Problem-solving and troubleshooting: When encountering issues or errors while using a library or framework, the documentation can be an invaluable resource. It often includes troubleshooting guides, common error messages, and solutions to help you resolve problems quickly. A lot of these documentations even have community forums if you have specific questions.

5. Efficiency in learning new tools: Once you become proficient in reading and understanding documentation, you can apply this skill to learn new libraries and frameworks more efficiently. Instead of relying on tutorials, you can dive directly into the documentation, grasp the key concepts, and start experimenting with the tool in your own projects. This greatly speeds up how fast you build new things and ship new projects!

Tips for reading documentation effectively:

1. Start with the overview or introduction: Begin by reading the high-level overview or introduction section of the documentation to gain a broad understanding of the library or framework's purpose, key features, and basic usage. A lot of websites include a "Quick start" or "New to this" section that introduce you to the library/framework.

2. Explore the API reference: Dive into the API reference section to understand the available classes, methods, and functions provided by the library or framework. Pay attention to the input parameters, return types, and any specific usage guidelines.

3. Look for code examples: Many documentation resources include code examples that demonstrate how to use specific features or solve common problems. Study these examples to see how the library or framework can be applied in practice.

4. Experiment and play around: Don't be afraid to experiment with the code and try out different features or configurations. Create small test projects or scripts to validate your understanding and explore the possibilities.

5. Refer to the documentation as a reference: Treat the documentation as a reference resource that you can consult whenever you need clarification or guidance on specific aspects of the library or framework.

By developing the skill of reading and understanding documentation, you can become a more versatile and efficient developer. While tutorials can be helpful for initial exposure to a new tool, relying on documentation allows you to adapt quickly, solve problems independently, and gain a deeper understanding of the libraries and frameworks you work with.
