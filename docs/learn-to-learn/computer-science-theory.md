Learning the underlying computer science theory is not strictly required to become a programmer, but it can provide a strong foundation that empowers you to work with various programming languages and tools more effectively. By understanding the fundamental concepts and principles behind programming, you gain a transferable skill set that allows you to adapt quickly to new languages and frameworks, often just by learning their specific syntaxes and idioms.

I feel like a lot of computer science theory is gatekept by the education system, a lot of people think you need a computer science degree to fully understand it. Well, I am here to tell you while it is nice to have, you do not actually need to go to college to learn computer science as long as you can keep yourself studying it. Don't worry! This course includes the theory side as well!

Here's how learning computer science theory along side programming can benefit you:

1. Language-agnostic knowledge: Computer science theory focuses on the core concepts and principles that are applicable across different programming languages. These include topics such as algorithms, data structures, programming paradigms (e.g., object-oriented, functional), and software design patterns. By mastering these concepts, you develop a language-agnostic understanding of programming, which enables you to grasp the fundamentals of any new language more easily.

2. Problem-solving skills: Computer science theory emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills. You learn how to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components, design efficient algorithms, and analyze the time and space complexity of your solutions. These skills are valuable regardless of the specific language or tool you are using, as they help you approach programming challenges in a structured and logical manner.

3. Abstraction and generalization: Theory teaches you to think in terms of abstractions and generalizations. You learn to identify common patterns and principles that can be applied across different programming contexts. This ability to abstract and generalize allows you to see the similarities and differences between languages and tools, making it easier to transfer your knowledge and skills from one to another.

4. Adaptability to new technologies: The field of programming is constantly evolving, with new languages, frameworks, and tools emerging regularly. By having a solid grasp of computer science theory, you are better equipped to understand and adapt to these new technologies. When you encounter a new language or framework, you can focus on learning its specific syntax and idiosyncrasies, while leveraging your existing theoretical knowledge to understand its underlying concepts and design principles.

5. Efficient learning and problem-solving: When you have a strong theoretical foundation, you can learn new languages and tools more efficiently. Instead of starting from scratch, you can draw parallels between the new language and the concepts you already know. This allows you to quickly map the new syntax and semantics to familiar programming constructs, reducing the learning curve and enabling you to become productive faster.

6. Collaborative and communicative abilities: Computer science theory provides a common language and vocabulary that programmers can use to communicate ideas and solutions effectively. When collaborating with other developers or working on complex projects, having a shared understanding of theoretical concepts facilitates clear communication and helps in designing robust and maintainable software systems.

It's important to note that while learning computer science theory is beneficial, it should be balanced with practical programming experience. Theory provides the foundation, but it's through hands-on coding, building projects, and solving real-world problems that you truly develop your programming skills.
